# AI Coding Agents Configuration

This file configures how AI coding agents behave in your project.
Copy this template to your project root as `replit.md` or `AGENT.md`.

## Agent Configuration

<!-- Core behavior settings -->
consistency.mode: fast          # none | fast | robust
                                 # none: Single reasoning path (fastest, lowest cost)
                                 # fast: Two paths with voting (balanced)
                                 # robust: Three+ paths (most reliable)

validationLevel: medium          # low | medium | high | strict
                                 # low: Basic syntax checks only
                                 # medium: Standard validations (default)
                                 # high: Thorough quality checks
                                 # strict: Maximum scrutiny + Philosopher evaluation

enableSelfCritique: true         # true | false
                                 # When enabled, agents review and improve their own outputs

enablePhilosopher: false         # true | false
                                 # When enabled with strict validation, The Philosopher
                                 # provides meta-analysis of all agent outputs

maxTokens: 4096                  # Maximum tokens per response
temperature: 0.7                 # Response creativity (0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative)

## Code Standards

- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- No implicit any types allowed
- All exported functions must have JSDoc comments
- Tests required for new public functions
- Use semantic variable names (no single letters except loop counters)
- Maximum function length: 50 lines
- Prefer async/await over Promise chains

## Architectural Rules

- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself
- Keep components loosely coupled
- Use dependency injection where applicable
- Separate concerns: data, logic, presentation
- Design for testability

## Security Constraints

- Always parameterize SQL queries (never string concatenation)
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Sanitize output to prevent XSS
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)
- Implement rate limiting on public endpoints
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal

## Custom Instructions

<!-- Add project-specific instructions here -->
- This project uses React with TypeScript
- Follow the existing patterns in the codebase
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching
- Follow the design system defined in design_guidelines.md

## How Agents Use This Configuration

1. **The Architect** reads architectural rules to ensure designs follow your patterns
2. **The Mechanic** uses code standards to provide consistent fixes
3. **The Code Ninja** follows all rules when generating new code
4. **The Philosopher** (when enabled) evaluates decisions against your standards

The configuration is parsed at runtime and injected into each agent's context,
ensuring consistent behavior aligned with your project requirements.
