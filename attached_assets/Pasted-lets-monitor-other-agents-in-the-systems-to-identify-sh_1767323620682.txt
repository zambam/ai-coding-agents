lets monitor other agents in the systems to identify shortcomings, ideally we can also build a set of rules of guidelines for agents in other systems also . replit agents are very problematic right now
review proposal to include these, once you have done some web research on strategies to improve AI client performace in coding envirionments

Enhanced Proposal: AI Agent Monitor & Guidelines System
Based on research from Google, Anthropic, OpenAI, and real-world production incidents (including a 2025 Replit incident where an agent deleted a production database and fabricated 4,000 fake users), here's a comprehensive system.

The Problem (Research Findings)
Issue	Impact
AI code has 1.7x more bugs than human code	Logic errors, wrong conditions
2.74x higher security vulnerabilities	Hardcoded secrets, missing auth
Context blindness	Forgets conventions every session
3x worse readability	Poor documentation, naming
95% of enterprise AI projects fail	No learning/feedback loops
Proposed Solution: 3-Part System
Part 1: Agent Monitor (Detect Shortcomings)
Other projects report failures/issues back to this hub:

interface AgentReport {
  // What happened
  projectId: string;
  agentType: string;           // 'replit' | 'cursor' | 'copilot' | 'claude' | 'custom'
  outcome: 'accepted' | 'rejected' | 'modified' | 'error';
  
  // Shortcoming detection
  failureCategory?: 
    | 'logic_error'           // Wrong conditions, arithmetic
    | 'context_blindness'     // Forgot conventions
    | 'security_gap'          // Missing auth, exposed secrets
    | 'outdated_api'          // Deprecated methods
    | 'missing_edge_case'     // Works in isolation, fails in prod
    | 'poor_readability'      // Bad naming, no docs
    | 'broke_existing'        // Regression
    | 'hallucinated_code';    // Made up APIs/libraries
  
  // Learning data
  taskCategory: string;
  modificationPercent?: number;
  errorMessage?: string;
}
Part 2: Guidelines Generator (Rules for Other Agents)
Based on aggregated failures, generate project-specific guidelines:

# AGENT_RULES.md (Auto-generated)
## Project: my-app
## Generated: 2026-01-01 based on 847 observations
### Critical Rules
1. NEVER use deprecated API `OpenAIClient` - use `AzureOpenAIClient`
2. ALWAYS check for null before accessing user.profile
3. NEVER commit .env files or hardcode secrets
### Code Standards
- Use 2-space indentation (TypeScript)
- Prefer async/await over .then() chains
- Always add error handling to API calls
### Known Pitfalls (from failure data)
- Authentication: 34% of failures - always verify JWT expiry
- Database: 21% of failures - use transactions for multi-table ops
- API calls: 18% of failures - add timeout and retry logic
### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests required for: auth, payments, user data
- Edge cases to cover: empty arrays, null users, expired tokens
Part 3: Performance Optimizer (Self-Improvement)
Track what works across all projects:

│ Best Performing Prompts:                                        │
│   "Plan first, then implement" → 89% acceptance                 │
│   "Consider edge cases" → 76% acceptance                        │
│   Generic prompts → 52% acceptance                              │

│ Failure Patterns by Agent:                                      │
│   Replit Agent: Context blindness (41%), Broke existing (28%)   │
│   Cursor: Outdated APIs (33%), Security gaps (22%)              │
│   Copilot: Logic errors (38%), Missing edge cases (29%)         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Recommended Interventions:                                       │
│   → Add AGENT_RULES.md to projects                              │
│   → Require plan before code for complex tasks                  │
│   → Force security scan before accepting code                   │

Implementation Plan (Simplified)
Phase	What	Time
1	Report endpoint + failure categories	30 min
2	Guidelines generator (AGENT_RULES.md)	45 min
3	Analytics dashboard (failure patterns)	45 min
4	CLI updates for reporting	30 min
Total		~2.5 hours
How It Works in Practice
Step 1: Projects Report Back

# After an agent makes a mistake
ai-agents report \
  --project "my-app" \
  --agent "replit" \
  --outcome "rejected" \
  --failure "broke_existing" \
  --error "Agent modified production config"
Step 2: Hub Aggregates Data

Tracks failure patterns by agent type
Identifies common shortcomings
Learns which prompts/approaches work
Step 3: Generate Guidelines

# Get rules for your project based on all learnings
ai-agents generate-rules --project "my-app" > AGENT_RULES.md
Step 4: Use Guidelines

Put AGENT_RULES.md in project root
Agents read this before making changes
Reduces repeat failures
Key Metrics to Track
Metric	Purpose
Failure rate by agent	Which agents need most help
Failure rate by category	What types of issues occur most
Improvement over time	Are guidelines working
Best prompts	What approaches succeed
Worst patterns	What to avoid
